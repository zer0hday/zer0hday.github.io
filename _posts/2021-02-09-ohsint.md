For this challenge we're given an image and must gather as much information about a target person as possible. As someone who has previously carried out OSINT professionally, I'll be using open-source websites available for everyone without needing Kali or any special software. 

The image (WinXP.jpg):

The image is the default wallpaper in Windows XP, [called "Bliss"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image)). To begin we'll look at the EXIF data in the image using exif.regex.info:

![EXIF data for Bliss image](/assets/images/ohsint/ohsint-02.png)

The copyright field lists "OWoodflint", which a quick Google search reveals 3 potential sources of information:

![Google search for 'OWoodflint'](/assets/images/ohsint/ohsint-03.png)

The first is a Twitter account, which has an **avatar of a cat** and a WAP BSSID (which we might need later!):

![OWoodflint Twitter feed](/assets/images/ohsint/ohsint-04.png)

Moving to the GitHub link, we get a city (**London**) and email address (**OWoodflint@gmail.com**) for the user:

![OWoodflint GitHub repository](/assets/images/ohsint/ohsint-05.png)

Unfortunately there are no more repos or activity under this account, but the username suggests there may be additional accounts under "OWoodfl1nt" on other services. 

Our final link is a basic WordPress site with a single post, where we learn the user has gone to **New York**:

This isn't the only piece of information on the post though. Inspecting the page source will reveal a hidden piece of text coloured white:

***pennYDr0pper.!*** looks suspiciously like a **password** given it has mixed case letters, a number and a couple of symbols...

Right now we have the user's avatar, cities they're in, an email address, a potential and their WiFi Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID). This BSSID is, in essence, the [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) of a wireless access point or wireleess router. The BSSID is used to identify which WAP a client is actually talking to in situations where there are multiple WAPs in a given wireless network. 

We can use a BSSID to look up an exact location for the access point with  https://wigle.net/, assuming someone has reported this to the site:

We enter the BSSID in the sarch box on the right, and since we know the user is from London, scrolling to London reveals an access point that Wigle knows about:

To view information about this WAP, we just zoom all the way in:

![Further zoomed in Wigle map showing WAP SSID](/assets/images/ohsint/ohsint-11.png)

We now have a name (SSID) for the user's WiFi: **UnileverWiFi**, and with that have gathered all the information for this particular challenge!

If this were a real OSINT investigation, we might move on to looking for additional accounts matching the GitHub username, or attempt to find information on people named "Oliver Woodflint" living in London using services such as 192.com. Remember that any passwords obtained during the course of an OSINT investigation should **never** be used to attempt to access their accounts unless you have explicit permission!
